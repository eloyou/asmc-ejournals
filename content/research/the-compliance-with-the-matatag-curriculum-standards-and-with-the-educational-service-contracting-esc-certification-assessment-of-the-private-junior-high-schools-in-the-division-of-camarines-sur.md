## Abstract

This study assessed the compliance with MATATAG Curriculum Standards and with the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment of the Private Junior High Schools in the Division of Camarines Sur. Further, it examined the level and extent of compliance, tested the significance of agreement on the rank orders of compliance levels, identified the challenges encountered, explored proposed solutions, and developed an action plan based on the findings of the study.

Employing descriptive-evaluative-correlational methods, the research utilizes statistical tools such as frequency count, weighted mean, percentage, and rank, Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W), and Chi-square test, at 0.05 level of significance.

The findings indicate a high level of compliance with the MATATAG curriculum standards across all areas, highlighting the extent of the highly compliant to the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment Standards of the Private Junior High Schools. However, challenges encountered in complying with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards and with the ESC Certification Assessment are highly challenging, such as limited Organizational Support, Operational Support, Instructional Support, and Stakeholders’ Engagement. Solutions to address these challenges were identified, including faculty and staff training programs to improve compliance efforts, strengthened monitoring mechanisms for compliance, and implemented action plans to address compliance challenges. An action plan was formulated for improved compliance with the Private Junior High Schools MATATAG Curriculum and with the ESC Certification Assessment Standards towards quality education, enhancing Stakeholders’ Support, teacher, Student Services Personnel, and administrative training, curriculum adjustments, and infrastructure improvements. Future research suggestions include broader-scale studies, such as investigating the long-term impact of compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum and ESC Certification Assessment Standards, exploring best practices in compliance monitoring, faculty capacity-building programs, and financial sustainability strategies to enhance school effectiveness, examining the role of stakeholder engagement in strengthening compliance efforts and ensuring sustainable institutional development, assessing the effectiveness of training and professional development programs in improving instructional leadership and regulatory adherence in private junior high schools, and evaluating the role of technology and digital tools in streamlining compliance documentation, instructional delivery, and assessment processes.

## Introduction

The education sector plays a significant role in shaping the future of a nation by equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills to thrive in society. In the Philippines, the government has implemented the K to 12 education programs, which includes the K to 10 Matatag curriculum, aimed at enhancing the quality of education and ensuring that students are adequately prepared for the demands of the modern world. Private schools in Camarines Sur, like their counterparts across the country, are expected to adhere to the standards and requirements set forth in the K to 10 MATATAG curriculum. Compliance with these standards is essential to provide students with a high-quality education that meets national benchmarks. Additionally, private schools may participate in the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) program, which provides financial assistance to students from low-income families attending private schools. Despite the implementation of the K to 10 MATATAG curriculum and the availability of the ESC program, the level of compliance among private schools in Camarines Sur remains uncertain. It is unclear whether these schools are fully adhering to the standards and requirements of the curriculum, as well as the criteria outlined in the ESC Certification Assessment Instrument 2018. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the quality of education provided by private schools in the region and the effectiveness of government initiatives aimed at improving access to education for all students.

Therefore, there is a need to investigate the level of compliance with the K to 10 Matatag curriculum's standards and requirements of the Private Schools in Camarines Sur, as well as with the criteria outlined in the ESC Certification Assessment Instrument 2018. By understanding the extent to which private schools are meeting these standards, policymakers, educators, and stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and develop targeted interventions to enhance the quality of education in the region.

The studies conducted by both foreign and local authors have significantly enriched the researcher's understanding and approach to their research. Lugos, A. et al. (2017), "Implementation of the K to 12 Curriculum in Selected Schools in the Philippines: A Case Study," discusses the readiness of private institutions in adopting the curriculum and the support mechanisms required. Orbeta, A. et al. (2016), "Private Schools’ Challenges in Implementing the K to 12 Program," outlines issues like funding and curriculum adaptation. According to Quisumbing, F. (2019), "Assessing the Effectiveness of the ESC Program in Private Schools in the Philippines," discusses how compliance with ESC standards influences the quality of education delivery in private institutions. Research explores how participation in the ESC program impacts schools' compliance with government standards. The ESC certification process ensures that schools are aligned with DepEd requirements, which could affect the quality of education and adherence to the K to 10 curriculum standards. According to Tamayo, M. (2020), "Private School Compliance with ESC Certification Standards in the Bicol Region," examines how schools meet certification criteria and the challenges they face. Various studies explore how schools comply with national educational standards, focusing on issues like curriculum delivery, adherence to learning outcomes, and resource adequacy. This literature supports the investigation into how private schools in Camarines Sur align with the MATATAG Curriculum and the ESC certification. According to Mercado, R. (2021), "Policy and Compliance in Philippine Education: An Analysis of DepEd Mandates," offers a detailed analysis of compliance challenges across different regions. Garcia, P. (2018), "Ensuring Quality in Private Education: An Assessment of Accreditation Systems and Compliance," explores private school accreditation in the context of DepEd requirements and the ESC program. These studies often use a compliance framework, reviewing how schools adopt new educational policies and whether they meet required standards, which is also related to the study of Santiago, A. (2022), "Evaluating Curriculum Implementation in Private Schools: A Focus on K to 12 Education in the Philippines," which discusses curriculum compliance, teacher preparedness, and resource availability.

## Methodology

Table 12 shows the summary of Compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards. All indicators rated much compliant in descending order were: School Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives, 4.45; Institutional Planning and Development, 4.41; Instructional Leadership, 4.39; Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction, 4.31; Academic Support and Student Development Services, 4.30; Administration and Governance, 4.18; Physical Plant and Instructional Support Facilities, 4.18; Faculty, 4.10; and School Budget and Finances, 4.04.

The highest-rated area was School Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives, earning a weighted mean of 4.45 and ranked first. This strong rating indicates that private junior high schools in Camarines Sur deeply adhere to their institutional identity and strategic directions, which are well-aligned with the MATATAG values of Maka-Diyos, Makatao, Makakalikasan, at Makabansa. Such clear articulation of core principles is crucial in sustaining educational quality, as affirmed by Reyes and De Leon (2021), who emphasized the role of institutional mission clarity in effective curriculum execution and school governance. Following this, Institutional Planning and Development and Instructional Leadership also demonstrated high compliance, suggesting a stable internal management system and strong leadership presence that supports MATATAG implementation. These findings resonate with Tan (2019) and Ramos (2020), who asserted that strategic leadership and planning are critical in driving curriculum alignment and teacher empowerment in private institutions.

On the other hand, the three lowest-rated dimensions, though still interpreted as Much Compliant, highlight key areas for strategic improvement. At the bottom was School Budget and Finances, reflecting challenges in resource generation, allocation, and financial sustainability. This is consistent with the findings of Villanueva and Ramos (2020), who identified that rural private schools often struggle with funding infrastructure and sustaining financial transparency. Ranked 8th was the Faculty domain, indicating gaps in faculty qualifications, training, and retention. Santiago and Reyes (2022) support this observation, stating that while private schools value teacher development, access to MATATAG-specific continuous professional development remains uneven. Additionally, Administration and Governance and Physical Plant and Instructional Support Facilities both shared, revealing comparable limitations in administrative consistency and adequacy of school facilities. These echo the challenges identified by Garcia and Manalo (2020), who emphasized that smaller private institutions often lack the capacity to upgrade and maintain facilities aligned with curriculum requirements.

This study employed Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W) to assess the level of agreement on concordance among the respondents who evaluated the significant agreement on the rank orders of the compliance of the Private Junior High Schools with MATATAG Curriculum Standards.

Table 13 reflects the findings which indicate low agreement among schools. The Coefficient of Concordance (W) and the computed Chi-square (χ²) value resulted to: School Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Goals and Objectives, 0.17 and 7.65 (p>0.05); Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction, 0.09 and 4.05 (p>0.05); Instructional Leadership, 0.22 and 9.90 (p>0.05); Faculty, 0.21 and 9.45 (p>0.05); Academic Support and Student Development Services, 0.15 and 6.75 (p>0.05); Physical Plant and Instructional Support Facilities, 0.16 and 7.20 (p>0.05); Administration and Governance, 0.26 and 11.70 (p>0.05); School Budget and Finances, 0.04 and 1.80 (p>0.05); and Institutional Planning and Development, 0.27 and 12.15 (p>0.05). Thus, the hypothesis was accepted. Among the dimensions, Administration and Governance exhibited the highest level of agreement (W = 0.26, χ² = 11.70), though still below the statistical significance threshold (p > 0.05). This suggests that governance policies and administrative structures are relatively more standardized among private schools, likely due to DepEd’s regulatory oversight. Research by Bush (2018) supports this, emphasizing that well-defined governance policies help minimize discrepancies in compliance assessments.

Conversely, the three dimensions with the lowest levels of agreement were School Budget and Finances (W = 0.04, χ² = 1.80, p > 0.05), Faculty (W = 0.21, χ² = 9.45, p > 0.05), and Instructional Leadership (W = 0.22, χ² = 9.90, p > 0.05). School Budget and Finances exhibited the lowest agreement, reflecting significant variations in financial resource allocation, funding models, and expenditure priorities across private institutions. Schools differ considerably in terms of tuition revenue, grants, and financial policies, contributing to disparities in compliance rankings. Lunenburg (2019) asserts that financial inconsistencies among private schools often result in inconsistent budgeting practices, further reinforcing the observed variability.

Similarly, Faculty compliance rankings showed substantial inconsistency, likely due to differences in teacher qualifications, professional development opportunities, and performance evaluation standards. Research by Darling-Hammond et al. (2020) suggests that schools with robust faculty training programs demonstrate stronger compliance with curriculum standards, while those with limited resources for teacher development tend to fall behind. The low Chi-square value (χ² = 1.80, p > 0.05) confirms the lack of statistical agreement in faculty-related compliance rankings. Instructional Leadership also displayed considerable ranking disparities, indicating inconsistencies in leadership effectiveness, instructional supervision, and teacher support mechanisms among private schools. According to Leithwood et al. (2017), instructional leadership effectiveness is strongly influenced by school culture, leadership training, and administrative priorities, factors that tend to vary significantly across institutions. With a computed Chi-square of 9.01, which did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05), there was no significant agreement in how instructional leadership compliance was ranked. Given the lack of significant agreement across compliance dimensions, several steps should be taken to improve consistency and standardization in private junior high schools. First, there should be a more standardized financial management system, including transparent budgeting models and centralized financial oversight, to reduce disparities in budget-related compliance (Lunenburg, 2019). Second, faculty development and credentialing should be strengthened by implementing minimum qualification standards, expanding professional development programs, and adopting standardized teacher evaluation frameworks to enhance compliance consistency (Darling-Hammond et al., 2020). Third, instructional leadership training must be prioritized, ensuring that school administrators and academic coordinators receive continuous training in instructional supervision and evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance uniformity in compliance (Leithwood et al., 2017).

Table 17 presents the summary of indicators evaluated to determine the compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards and the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment of Private Junior High Schools in the Division of Camarines Sur. The indicators rated Very Much Compliant, in descending order, were: the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) Team’s School Certification Report with a weighted mean of 4.75; followed by the School Certification Assessment Instrument Report at 4.51; and the MATATAG Curriculum Areas at 4.50.

These results reveal a strong level of adherence by the respondent schools to external validation and structured compliance tools mandated by accrediting bodies. The very high compliance with the PEAC School Certification Report suggests that schools prioritize formal evaluations and consider PEAC's recommendations as authoritative and essential for sustaining their ESC participation. Similarly, the high rating for the School Certification Assessment Instrument implies that schools are effectively utilizing standard protocols in evaluating their compliance with DepEd and PEAC benchmarks. The strong performance in MATATAG Curriculum Areas reflects a focused implementation of the new curriculum’s foundational skills, values-based education, and competency-driven learning outcomes.

In contrast, the bottom three indicators with the lowest weighted means, suggesting relatively lower levels of compliance, were observed in the areas of Infrastructure and Facilities, Internal Monitoring Systems, and Faculty Training and Development. These findings indicate that while schools are highly responsive to external assessment tools, internal systems that ensure sustainability and self-regulation remain underdeveloped. The lower rating on infrastructure may be attributed to financial constraints and location-based disparities, particularly among rural private institutions. Meanwhile, insufficient faculty development suggests a gap in the continuous upgrading of teacher skills, especially in aligning teaching practices with MATATAG curriculum competencies. The underperformance in internal monitoring points to a need for schools to institutionalize self-assessment mechanisms that go beyond compliance for accreditation purposes.

To address these concerns, schools are encouraged to institutionalize a capacity-building framework focused on long-term faculty development, infrastructure planning, and the integration of systematic internal quality assurance. Targeted solutions include prioritizing investment in school facilities through external partnerships, allocating professional development funds, and forming dedicated compliance task forces.

The implications of these findings reinforce the conclusions of previous studies. Bautista (2020) emphasized that private schools often struggle with infrastructure and faculty development due to limited institutional support. Similarly, Villanueva and Torres (2023) found that schools with regular professional development sessions and structured internal monitoring systems were more compliant with national standards. Cruz and Bautista (2020) also observed that academic and governance compliance were generally met, but infrastructural and training concerns persist—especially in resource-challenged areas. These studies affirm the necessity of strategic interventions that strengthen not only the external compliance responses but also the internal mechanisms for sustained curriculum implementation and quality assurance.

Assessing the extent of compliance with the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment Standards among Private Junior High Schools is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of the MATATAG Curriculum. Utilizing the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (W) and the Chi-square test, this analysis identifies the significance of agreement among respondents and determines areas requiring improvement.

In Table 18, the Coefficient of Concordance (W) and the computed Chi-square (χ²) value resulted to: School Evidence on the MATATAG Curriculum Areas, 0.30 and 13.50 (p>0.05), School Certification Assessment Instrument Report 0.16 and 7.70 (p>0.05), and Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) Team’s School Certification Report 0.18 and 8.10 (p>0.05). Thus, the null hypothesis was accepted.

The findings suggest inconsistencies in compliance reporting across various indicators, particularly in the School Evidences on the MATATAG Curriculum Areas, where the highest variability was observed. This variability may stem from differences in the documentation of compliance, as some schools may maintain better records of adherence to MATATAG Curriculum standards than others. The study of Cruz and Ramos (2020) supports this assertion, noting that discrepancies in compliance documentation often arise due to varying levels of administrative capacity among schools.

Similarly, the moderate agreement in the School Certification Assessment Instrument Report suggests challenges in the uniform implementation of assessment standards. According to Bautista and Lim (2021), compliance with certification instruments is often influenced by differences in school governance, resource allocation, and faculty training. The lowest agreement found in the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) Team’s School Certification Report indicates the least consistency in compliance assessments, possibly due to variations in the interpretation of PEAC guidelines across schools.

Table 23 presents the summary of challenges faced by the private junior high schools in their compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum and the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment Standards.

The indicators, ranked from most to least challenging based on their weighted mean, are as follows: Organizational Support, 4.12; Operational Support, 3.90; Instructional Support, 3.30; and Stakeholder Engagement, 3.25.

The highest-rated challenge, Organizational Support, implies that schools experience significant difficulty in aligning leadership structures, governance, and internal administrative processes to support compliance requirements. This may be attributed to the lack of full-time compliance coordinators, insufficient delegation mechanisms, and the absence of strategic planning tailored for sustained curriculum and ESC standard implementation. Operational Support, ranked second, highlights issues with logistical, clerical, and human resource systems that are necessary for implementing curriculum reforms and maintaining required documentation. The lowest three challenges—Instructional Support, Stakeholder Engagement, and to some extent Operational Support—suggest that schools still grapple with classroom-level execution, faculty preparedness, and limited involvement of parents and community partners in the compliance ecosystem.

These findings call for targeted interventions. Schools should strengthen their internal governance by forming dedicated compliance units, streamlining communication systems, and integrating compliance responsibilities into institutional planning. Professional development programs focused on instructional leadership and curriculum management are also recommended. Engagement of stakeholders must be improved by conducting regular orientations and feedback sessions with parents, local government units, and community partners. The development and adoption of a unified internal evaluation system can also address inconsistencies in operations and monitoring.

The results resonate with the findings of Villanueva and Ramos (2020), who reported that rural private schools in the Philippines commonly struggle with weak administrative capacity and limited access to compliance tools. Similarly, Rahman and Tay (2020) noted that private institutions across Southeast Asia face systemic difficulties in balancing autonomy and compliance due to governance fragmentation. These findings validate the importance of strong organizational infrastructure in ensuring curriculum and certification adherence. Conversely, studies by Salazar and Cruz (2021) argued that school administrators who employ collaborative leadership strategies and allocate sufficient institutional support report fewer compliance issues—highlighting that governance reform and capacity building are critical paths forward. Therefore, enhancing organizational and operational structures remains a crucial step in addressing the root causes of compliance-related challenges under both the MATATAG Curriculum and the ESC Certification Assessment Standards.

This section presents the findings related to the solutions implemented by private junior high schools in Camarines Sur to address the challenges of compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum and the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment Instrument 2018.

Table 24 presents the different responses where the indicators rated very much needed were: Faculty and staff training programs are provided to improve compliance efforts, 5.00; The school has strengthened monitoring mechanisms for compliance, 5.00; A long-term strategic plan has been developed to ensure sustained compliance, 4.93; The school has implemented action plans to address compliance challenges, 4.96; Other interventions such as engaging independent auditors and forming a dedicated compliance team, 4.53; establishing reward programs, and benchmarking with other schools, 4.43; Educating students and parents about compliance, 4.26; Allocating additional resources, 4.13; Compliance strategies are regularly reviewed and updated, 3.63; Collaboration with stakeholders has been enhanced, 3.96; Tailoring professional development programs based on individual needs, 3.83. The top-rated indicator—faculty and staff training programs—emerged as the highest priority solution. Its high rating implies that respondents recognize capacity-building among educators as the cornerstone of compliance. This is consistent with the findings of Villanueva and Torres (2023), which affirmed that teacher preparedness, through structured training programs, significantly boosts the implementation of national curriculum standards. Similarly, Santiago and Reyes (2022) emphasized that continuous professional development has a direct impact on curriculum alignment and classroom execution. In contrast, the three lowest-rated indicators—compliance strategy reviews, tailored professional development, and stakeholder collaboration—suggest that reflective practice, individualized training, and external partnerships are either underutilized or undervalued. These findings may reflect time constraints, lack of institutional support, or minimal engagement with stakeholders. According to Cruz and Bautista (2020), one of the pressing challenges for rural schools is the limited engagement with external partners, while Rahman and Tay (2020) highlighted that schools often find it difficult to align professional development with specific compliance-related skill gaps.

Findings from other international contexts support these observations. For instance, Pillay and Naidoo (2019) reported that South African private schools with continuous teacher development and strong community links were more successful in curriculum adherence. Similarly, the global study by UNESCO (2019) underscored the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and adaptive teacher training in enhancing curriculum implementation in low-resource environments.

The compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards and the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment of the private junior high schools necessitates an understanding of the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented.

Table 25 presents the test for significant agreement on the rank orders of the challenges faced and the solutions offered. The Coefficient of Concordance (W) and the computed Chi-square (χ²) value resulted to: Challenges Faced were: Organizational Support, 0.11 and 4.95 (p>0.05), Operational Support, 0.11 and 4.50 (p>0.05), Instructional Support, 0.10 and 4.50 (p>0.05), Stakeholders’ Engagement, 0.09 and 4.05 (p>0.05), thus, the null hypothesis was accepted except on Solution Offered, 0.62 and 43.40 (p < 0.001). These results suggest that while schools had differing perspectives on the severity of the challenges, likely due to variations in institutional resources, leadership practices, and community engagement, they demonstrated a clear consensus on the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. This consensus underscores the shared understanding among stakeholders of what interventions are necessary, such as faculty development, enhanced internal monitoring, and strategic planning. The findings support the relevance and applicability of the Action Plan, which aims to standardize and strengthen compliance efforts across private junior high schools in the division, fostering consistency, sustainability, and improved educational outcomes.
