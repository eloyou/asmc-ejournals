## Introduction

Education is a vital foundation for developing learners’ skills, yet classrooms are often composed of students with diverse abilities, interests, and learning styles, making it challenging for teachers to address every learner’s needs through uniform instruction. Differentiated instruction (DI) has been recognized globally and in the Philippine context as an effective learner-centered approach that adapts content, process, and activities to suit individual differences, thereby promoting inclusivity, engagement, and improved academic performance. Despite its potential benefits, little is known about how differentiated instruction is effectively utilized in classroom settings, particularly in private institutions such as Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc., where teachers strive to enhance the learning experiences of elementary pupils. Thus, this study seeks to determine the effectiveness of utilizing differentiated instruction activities among elementary learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc., with the aim of providing answers on how differentiated instructions activities can improve student learning engagement, academic performance, learning outcomes, learning motivation, and support quality education delivery.

The studies of both foreign and local authors have greatly contributed to understanding the effectiveness of utilization of differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners. Robinson et al. (2015) found that DI supports flexible grouping and enrichment tasks but faces challenges such as limited training and time. Similarly, Ismajli and Imami-Morina (2018) and Melesse (2015) noted that teachers value DI but struggle with large classes, rigid curricula, and lack of professional development. Hatmanto and Rahmawati (2023) revealed that Filipino teachers had positive attitudes toward DI yet faced issues in classroom management and resources, while Lester (2023), Mede and Sapan (2022), and Gülşen and Mede (2019) showed that DI enhances engagement, motivation, and autonomy in English learning. Meanwhile, Insorio (2024), Setiawan et al. (2023), and Asriadi et al. (2023) confirmed DI’s strong effectiveness in STEM, mathematics, and across subjects. Likewise, Grecu (2022) and Lunsford (2017) highlighted that despite DI’s value, teachers encounter barriers such as rigid curricula, insufficient time, and limited support. In the local context, Aranda et al. (2016), Sapad and Caballes (2015), and Aquino and De Guzman (2021) proved that DI improved performance, inclusivity, and engagement in Filipino, Science, and elementary education.

## Methodology

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of utilization of differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. Additionally, it assessed the extent of the level of Effectiveness of utilization of Differentiated Instructions activities among Elementary learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. along with learning engagement, academic performance, learning outcomes and learning motivation. The significance in the rank orders of the level of effectiveness of the utilization of differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners. Difficulties while utilizing the differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners and the significance of agreement encountered while utilizing the differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners. Finally, policy recommendations were formulated based on the findings of the study to enhance the use of differentiated instruction as a tool for promoting inclusive and effective learning among elementary learners.

This study employed the descriptive-evaluative-inferential research method. The descriptive method was used to present the profile of elementary learners and the implementation of differentiated instruction activities at Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. Various statistical tools, such as frequency count, percentage, weighted mean, and rank, were utilized to analyze the data and assess the effectiveness of differentiated instruction. Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance W (Siegel, 1998) was applied to determine the degree of agreement on the effectiveness and challenges of DI activities, while the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for significant differences in learners’ perceptions.

### The Five-Point Rating Scale for Jurors’ Rating Form

A five-point rating scale was used to assess the effectiveness of differentiated instruction activities among elementary learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. The scale was adapted and modified from the questionnaires on the evaluation of instructional materials and learning activities developed by Avila (2016) and Batanes (2012). The interpretation of the scale was adjusted to fit the specific objectives of the study, ensuring that it accurately reflected learners’ perceptions of the effectiveness and challenges of differentiated instruction.

### Table 11. Difficulties encountered by the learners while utilizing the differentiated instructions activities

| Indicators | Weighted Mean | Interpretation | Rank |
|------------|---------------|----------------|------|
| 1          | 1.63          | Fairly Difficult | 13.5 |
| 2          | 1.63          | Fairly Difficult | 13.5 |

| 6          | 2.54          | Difficult        | 3    |
| 7          | 1.91          | Fairly Difficult | 7.5  |
| 8          | 1.91          | Fairly Difficult | 7.5  |
| 9          | 1.79          | Fairly Difficult | 12   |
| 10         | 2.83          | Difficult        | 1    |
| 11         | 1.62          | Fairly Difficult | 15   |
| 12         | 2.50          | Difficult        | 4    |
| 13         | 2.64          | Difficult        | 2    |
| 14         | 2.00          | Fairly Difficult | 6    |
| 15         | 1.88          | Fairly Difficult | 9    |
| **Average**| **2.06**      | **Fairly Difficult** |      |

On Table 11 are the difficulties encountered by the learners in the utilization of differentiated instruction activities. The table shows fifteen (15) indicators of difficulties. First in rank with a weighted mean of 2.83, interpreted as “Fairly Difficult,” was the statement “I find it challenging to keep up with differentiated instruction activities when they are too fast-paced.” Second in rank was “I find it hard to meet expectations for differentiated instruction activities because they are not well-explained” (2.64), followed by “I struggle to stay motivated when differentiated instruction tasks are too difficult” (2.54) and “Some differentiated instruction activities take too much time and affect my ability to finish tasks” (2.50), all of which were interpreted as “Fairly Difficult.” The least in rank was “I feel that some differentiated instruction activities are too easy and do not challenge me enough” with a weighted mean of 1.62, interpreted as “Difficult,” followed by “I feel disconnected from the lesson when differentiated instruction activities are used” (1.63), interpreted as “Difficult”, and “I find it hard to stay engaged in class during differentiated instruction activities” (1.63), interpreted as “Difficult”. Overall, the average weighted mean of 2.06 revealed that the learners rated the difficulties they encountered as “Fairly Difficult.” This implies that while learners faced some challenges in terms of pacing, clarity of instruction, and sustaining motivation, the difficulties were not overwhelmingly burdensome, but still need to be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of differentiated instruction activities. Addressing these concerns will not only improve learning experiences but also ensure that differentiated instruction achieves its goal of catering to diverse learner needs.

To determine whether there is a significant agreement on the rank orders of the level of effectiveness in the utilization of differentiated instruction activities among elementary learners, the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (W) was computed. As reflected in Table 12, the computed W and Chi-square (X²) values were as follows: Learning Engagement – 0.25 and 3 (p>0.05); Academic Performance – 0.0259 and 0.3108 (p>0.05); Learning Outcomes – 0.35 and 4.2 (p>0.05); and Learning Motivation – 0.7833 and 9.3996 (p>0.05). When compared to the X² tabular values at the 0.05 level of significance, the computed values failed to reach the criterion, leading to the acceptance of the null hypothesis. This means that there is no significant agreement on the rank orders of effectiveness across the four dimensions. The results suggest that the impact of differentiated instruction on learners’ engagement, performance, outcomes, and motivation varies, indicating differences in how students perceive and experience its effectiveness.

To test whether there is a significant agreement on the rank orders of the difficulties encountered in utilizing differentiated instruction activities, the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (W) and Chi-square (X²) were also employed. As shown in Table 12, the computed W was 0.6279 and the computed Chi-square (X²) was 26.3718 (p>0.05). When compared to the X² tabular values at the 0.05 level of significance, the computed Chi-square exceeded the criterion, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative hypothesis. This indicates that there is a significant agreement among learners regarding the difficulties they encounter in the use of differentiated instruction activities. Such results highlight that these challenges are common and need to be addressed by educators to ensure that instructional strategies remain accessible, well-explained, and responsive to diverse learning needs.

## Conclusions

The following conclusions are drawn:

1. The extent of the level of effectiveness of utilization of differentiated instructions activities among elementary learners are Very Much Effective, Much Effective, Much Effective and Much Effective along with learning engagement, academic performance, learning outcomes, and learning motivation.
