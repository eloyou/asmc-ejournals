## INTRODUCTION

This study assessed the **compliance with MATATAG Curriculum Standards** and the **Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment** of the Private Junior High Schools in the Division of Camarines Sur. Specifically, it examined the **level and extent of compliance**, tested the **significance of agreement in rank orders**, identified the **challenges encountered**, explored **proposed solutions**, and developed an **action plan** based on the findings.

## METHODOLOGY

A **descriptive-evaluative-correlational** research design was employed using **researcher-made questionnaires**. Data were analyzed using **frequency**, **percentage**, **weighted mean**, **rank order**, **Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W)**, and **Chi-square test**, with a **0.05 level of significance**.

## RESULTS

The findings revealed that all indicators of the MATATAG Curriculum Standards were rated **Much Compliant (MC)** in descending order of weighted means:

- **School Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives (4.45)**
- **Institutional Planning and Development (4.41)**
- **Instructional Leadership (4.39)**
- **Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction (4.31)**
- **Academic Support and Student Development Services (4.30)**
- **Faculty (4.10)**
- **Physical Plant and Instructional Support Facilities (4.10)**
- **Administration and Governance (4.10)**
- **School Budget and Finances (4.00)**

The test for **significance of agreement** in rank orders of compliance levels with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards showed that all **W and χ² values were not significant (p > 0.05)**; hence, the **hypothesis was accepted**.

In terms of compliance with ESC Certification Assessment Standards, all indicators were rated **Very Much Compliant (VMC)** with the following mean scores:

- **PEAC Team’s School Certification Report (4.75)**
- **School Certification Assessment Instrument Report (4.51)**
- **MATATAG Curriculum Areas (4.50)**

Similarly, tests showed that **all indicators had (p > 0.05)**, meaning the **null hypothesis was accepted**.

For the **challenges encountered**, results in descending order of weighted means revealed:

- **Organizational Support (4.12)** — _Much Challenging (MC)_
- **Operational Support (3.90)** — _Much Challenging (MC)_
- **Instructional Support (3.30)** — _Challenging (C)_
- **Stakeholder Engagement (3.25)** — _Challenging (C)_

The **proposed solutions** were rated **Much Needed (MN)** with an **overall weighted mean of 4.41**, indicating a **very high level of need**, including:

- **Faculty and staff training programs (5.00)**
- **Strengthened monitoring mechanisms (5.00)**
- **Implemented action plans (4.96)**

Tests revealed that **all indicators of challenges had (p > 0.05)** (null hypothesis accepted), but for **proposed solutions**, **W = 0.62 and χ² = 43.40 were found significant (p < 0.001)**; thus, the **null hypothesis was rejected**. Based on these, an **Action Plan** was formulated.

## DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

1. The level of compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards is **Much Compliant**.
2. There is **no significant agreement** in the rank orders of compliance with the MATATAG Curriculum Standards among the respondents.
3. The level of compliance with the ESC Certification Assessment Standards is **Very Much Compliant**.
4. There is **no significant agreement** in the rank orders of ESC compliance among the respondents.
5. Challenges encountered were rated **Challenging to Much Challenging**.
6. The level of need for proposed solutions is **Much Needed**.
7. There is **no significant agreement** in the challenges' rank orders, but a **significant agreement** exists in the proposed solutions.
8. An **Action Plan** was developed based on the findings.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **School administrators** should align goals with curriculum standards, enhance **technology integration**, and improve **teacher competency**.
2. **DepEd and private school associations** should create a **unified tool** for assessing MATATAG compliance.
3. **Schools must prioritize** better documentation, instructional quality, and staff training aligned with ESC standards.
4. Use a **standardized reporting framework** to reduce inconsistencies in evaluations.
5. **Allocate resources**, minimize teacher workload, and involve faculty in compliance planning.
6. Immediately implement **training programs**, **monitoring systems**, and **strategic plans** based on data.
7. **Context-based implementation** of solutions should be ensured, using **school-level diagnostics**.
8. Implement the **Action Plan** to drive continuous improvement in compliance with both standards.
