## Abstract

This study investigates the acceptability of self-learning modules in Physical Science among Senior High School learners at the University of Northeastern Philippines in the context of the new normal education setup. Through a comprehensive analysis of various dimensions including Objectives, Content, Language Level, Assessment, and Time Frame, the study evaluates the effectiveness and suitability of these modules. Employing descriptive-evaluative-inferential-correlational methods, the research utilizes statistical tools such as frequency count, weighted mean, percentage, and rank. The findings indicate a high level of acceptability across all dimensions among both learners and jurors, highlighting the effectiveness of the self-learning approach. However, challenges such as limited laboratory experiences due to COVID-19 protocols were identified. Policy recommendations are formulated to enhance parental support, teacher training, curriculum adjustments, and infrastructure improvements. Future research suggestions include broader-scale studies, designs for teacher training, experimental interventions, and the construction of appropriate instructional self-learning modules in science. Overall, the study underscores the importance of adapting educational strategies to the evolving landscape of education amidst the pandemic.
