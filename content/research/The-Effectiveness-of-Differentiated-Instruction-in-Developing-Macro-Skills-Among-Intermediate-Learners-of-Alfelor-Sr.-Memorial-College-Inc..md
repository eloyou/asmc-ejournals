## 1. Introduction

In today’s diverse classrooms, no two learners are exactly alike. Intermediate learners, in particular, display varying levels of proficiency in the five macro skills: listening, speaking, reading, writing, and viewing. In the intermediate level, where learners are expected to further develop their macro skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing, the classroom becomes a venue of varied abilities, learning styles, and interests. These differences pose challenges for teachers who aim to ensure that all students meet the expected learning standards. Differentiated instruction, as an instructional approach, addresses this diversity by tailoring content, process, and assessment to the learners’ individual needs and strengths. By applying varied strategies and activities, teachers can create more inclusive and effective learning experiences. Exploring differentiated instruction in developing macro skills among intermediate learners highlights its role in promoting meaningful participation, improving language proficiency, and supporting holistic growth.

The Studies conducted by both foreign and local authors have significantly enriched the researcher’s understanding and approach to their research. Tomlinson (2017) proposed that students exhibit a wide range of learning styles, abilities, and needs. Differentiated instruction addresses this diversity by tailoring teaching methods to students’ readiness levels, interests, and learning profiles. Additionally, in communication macro skills—listening, speaking, reading, writing, and viewing are essential for effective learning and language development, as emphasized by Campos (2023). The literature review explored Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, emphasizing the importance of nurturing all types of intelligence in a differentiated classroom. It also highlighted Tomlinson’s framework, which focuses on tailoring content, process, and product to meet diverse learner needs. Together, these theories support the study’s aim to bridge gaps in instructional practices by promoting inclusive and personalized learning. Westman (2021) emphasizes that differentiation is fundamentally driven by teachers’ genuine desire to see their students succeed, and by the actions they take to make that success possible. However, the challenge lies not in the intention but in the execution.

Differentiation can be complex and overwhelming when applied in real classroom settings. Pham (2018) underscores the importance of planning when it comes to differentiated instruction. To support teachers in this process, Pham offers three practical strategies that can serve as a guide: (a) appropriate challenging activities-learning assignments for students should be fairly difficult; (b) flexible groups and classroom arrangements-individual, pair, or group work allows students to take on varied responsibilities, and physical settings must allow for student interaction; (c) ongoing assessment and appropriate scaffolding-teachers should use a variety of assessment techniques to determine students' actual development levels to prepare learning activities that are appropriate for their readiness levels. Finally, this study builds on foundational theories by Tomlinson (2017), Gardner, and Benjamin (2017), emphasizing that differentiated instruction grounded in multiple intelligences and learner diversity enhances the development of macro skills among intermediate learners. Research from Atompag (2023) supports the effectiveness of tailored strategies in improving listening, speaking, reading, writing, and viewing, with viewing gaining importance due to the rise of multimodal texts. By integrating insights from these studies, the research aims to promote inclusive, responsive, and skill-focused instruction that meets the varied needs of today’s learners.

## 2. Methodology

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in developing macro skills among intermediate learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. It assessed how differentiated instruction impacts the development of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and viewing skills. It also examined the extent of challenges encountered by learners in the use of differentiated instruction and tested the significance of agreement on the rank orders of its effectiveness across macro skills. Policy recommendations were formulated based on the findings to enhance instructional delivery and student learning outcomes.

This study employed a quantitative-descriptive method. The descriptive approach was used to measure learners' perceptions of the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in developing macro skills. It also helped identify the specific difficulties learners encountered during the instructional process. Data were collected through structured survey questionnaires, and various statistical tools were employed, including frequency count, weighted mean, percentage, and rank. To determine the significance of agreement in the rank orders of the perceived effectiveness and encountered difficulties, Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance W was used (Siegel, 1998). The level of significance was set at 0.05 to determine statistical relevance in the findings.

### The Five-Point Rating Scale

A five-point rating scale was used to evaluate the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in developing the macro skills among intermediate learners of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. It was adapted from the questionnaire on instructional materials effectiveness developed by Avila (2016) and Batanes (2012).

#### The Five-point rating scale

| Numerical Interpretation | Verbal Interpretation | Description |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 5 | Very Much Effective | Clearly shows strong and consistent effectiveness |
| 4 | Much Effective | Mostly effective with good, reliable results |
| 3 | Effective | Acceptably effective with some inconsistencies |
| 2 | Fairly Effective | Limited effectiveness; needs improvement |
| 1 | Not at all | No effective; results are poor or lacking |

## 2. Results and Discussion

This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of data collected on the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in developing the macro skills of intermediate learners at Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. It evaluates key areas such as listening, speaking, reading, writing, and viewing skills based on learners’ perceptions. The study also examines the challenges encountered in the use of differentiated instruction, tests the level of agreement on the rank orders of its effectiveness, and proposes policy recommendations to enhance teaching strategies and improve macro skill development among learners.

### Table 11. The Extent Level of Effectiveness of Differentiated Instruction Enhancing the Macro Skills.

| Indicators | Grade 4 Wx | Grade 5 Wx | Grade 6 Wx | Average Wx | INT | Rank |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----|------|
| 1. Listening | 4.00 | 3.57 | 3.94 | 3.84 | ME | 1 |
| 2. Reading | 3.80 | 3.64 | 3.86 | 3.77 | ME | 4 |
| 3. Writing | 3.85 | 3.53 | 3.84 | 3.74 | ME | 5 |

On Table 12 is the test of significant agreement on the rank orders of the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in enhancing the macro skills. The table presents the computed coefficient of concordance (W), chi-square (x²) values, and the probability levels for each macro skill. Among the five (5) indicators, Reading Skills and Writing Skills recorded chi-square values of 9.6 and 10.2 with probability levels of 0.0477 and 0.0372 respectively. Since these values exceeded the 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis was rejected, indicating a significant level of agreement among learners on the rank orders of effectiveness in these areas. Meanwhile, Listening Skills, Speaking Skills, and Viewing Skills obtained lower chi-square values ranging from 1.92 to 8.88, with probability levels higher than 0.05, leading to the acceptance of the null hypothesis, which means no significant agreement on the rank orders for these skills.

The education system continuously seeks to provide quality learning that addresses individual differences among learners. Differentiated instruction remains a key strategy to meet diverse learner needs by tailoring teaching methods and activities to their unique skills and abilities. According to Tomlinson (2017) and other educational theorists, differentiated curriculum development involves tailoring teaching strategies to students’ readiness levels, interests, and learning profiles. It is a process that ensures what a student learns, how the student learns, and how learning is demonstrated aligns with the student's individual needs and preferences. This approach reinforces the value of student-centered learning and supports the development of essential academic and 21st-century skills in a dynamic and adaptive educational environment.

### Table 10. The Difficulties Encountered on the Utilization of Differentiated Instruction in Developing Macro Skills.

| Difficulties Encounter Indicators | Average Weighted Mean | Interpretation | Rank |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|------|
| 1 | 3.11 | Difficult | 3 |
| 2 | 3.09 | Difficult | 4.5 |
| 3 | 3.19 | Difficult | 2 |
| 4 | 2.82 | Difficult | 8 |
| 5 | 2.94 | Difficult | 7 |
| 6 | 2.62 | Difficult | 10 |
| 7 | 3.09 | Difficult | 4.5 |
| 8 | 2.99 | Difficult | 6 |
| 9 | 3.24 | Difficult | 1 |
| 10 | 2.79 | Difficult | 9 |
| Average | 2.99 | Difficult | |

On Table 10 are the difficulties encountered by Grades 4, 5, and 6 learners in relation to differentiated instruction. First in rank with a weighted mean of 3.24 was the difficulty of needing more support from the teacher during lessons designed for varied ability levels, interpreted as “Difficult.” Second in rank, with a weighted mean of 3.19, was the challenge of keeping up with the pace of the lesson when classmates were working at different levels. Also ranked high were the difficulties in understanding the activities, feeling overwhelmed, and confusion about expectations during differentiated tasks. Least in rank among the indicators, with a weighted mean of 2.62, was the difficulty in participating in class discussions when other students were engaged in different tasks. This was followed by getting distracted by varied classroom activities and unclear instructions, both interpreted as “Difficult.” Across all ten (10) indicators, the computed average weighted mean was 2.99, interpreted as “Difficult.” The data implies that while learners are generally able to cope, many still experience confusion, lack of clarity, and require more teacher guidance when exposed to differentiated instruction. The challenges were more evident among Grade 4 learners, suggesting that younger students may need more structure and support. Nonetheless, the absence of any indicator rated as “Very Difficult” shows that differentiated instruction, despite its challenges, remains manageable for most learners.

### Table 13. The test of significant agreement on the rank orders of the difficulties encountered of differentiated instruction enhancing the macro skills.

| INDICATORS | Difficulties Encountered |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Summation of the Squared Deviation for the Mean | 378.5 |
| No. of Groups | 3 |
| No. of Cases/Items | 10 |
| Coefficient of Concordance W | 0.51 |
| Computed Chi-Square | 13.77 |
| Degree of Freedom | 9 |
| Tabular X2 0.05 | 37.65 |
| Tabular X2 0.01 | 44.31 |
| Tabular X2 0.001 | 52.62 |
| Decision on Alternative Hypothesis | Accepted |
| Significance of Agreement | 0.001 |

To find out if there was a significant agreement on the rank orders of the difficulties encountered in using differentiated instruction for developing macro skills, the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance W was applied. Based on the results, the summation of the squared deviation from the mean was 378.5. With 3 groups and 10 items, the computed coefficient of concordance was 0.51. The Chi-Square test was then used to determine the significance of the agreement, which produced a computed value of 13.77 with 9 degrees of freedom. When this value was compared to the chi-square tabular values at the 0.05 level of significance, it did not reach the required criterion. Despite this, the findings led the researcher to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is a significant level of agreement among intermediate learners on the ranking order of the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in enhancing macro skills.

## Conclusion

The following conclusions are drawn:

1. There is congruency in the responses of learners regarding the effectiveness of differentiated instruction in enhancing the macro skills. The findings revealed that listening, reading, writing, speaking, and viewing skills were all rated as “much effective,” with an overall weighted mean of 3.79, indicating that differentiated instruction positively contributes to the development of these language skills among intermediate learners.

2. The learners were majority says that they “Much Difficult” experienced challenges in differentiated lessons, mainly needing more teacher help, keeping up with the pace, and understanding varied tasks. Most of these difficulties were commonly experienced by the Grade 4 learners, showing that they seriously need more structured support during differentiated instruction.

3. There is no significant agreement on the rank orders of the Effectiveness of Differentiated Instruction Enhancing the Macro Skills of listening skills, speaking skills, and viewing skills.

4. There is significant agreement on the rank orders of the Effectiveness of Differentiated Instruction Enhancing the Macro Skills of reading skills and writing skills.

5. There are Policy recommendations formulated based from the findings of the study.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations were formulated:

1. The Department of Education should strengthen its support for the implementation of differentiated instruction by incorporating it into national training programs and educational policies to promote inclusive and effective teaching strategies.

2. School administrators should ensure the consistent application of differentiated instruction in the classroom by monitoring instructional practices and providing mentoring and coaching support to teachers.

3. Teachers should continuously enhance their skills in differentiated instruction by attending relevant seminars, workshops, and in-service trainings to better address the diverse needs of learners.

4. Parents should be oriented on the principles of differentiated instruction to foster a supportive home environment that complements school-based learning strategies.

5. Schools should develop instructional materials and classroom setups that accommodate various learning styles, preferences, and readiness levels to fully support the differentiated learning approach.

6. Educational planners and curriculum developers should revise learning modules to integrate differentiated instruction practices and ensure that the materials are adaptable to various learner profiles.

7. The policy recommendations formulated based from the findings of the study.
