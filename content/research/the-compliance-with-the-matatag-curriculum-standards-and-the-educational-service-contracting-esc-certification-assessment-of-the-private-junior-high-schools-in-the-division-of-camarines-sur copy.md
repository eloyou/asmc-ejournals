This study assessed the compliance with MATATAG Curriculum Standards and the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) Certification Assessment of the Private Junior High Schools in the Division of Camarines Sur. Specifically, it examined the level and extent of compliance, tested the significance of agreement in the rank orders of compliance levels, identified the challenges encountered, explored proposed solutions, and developed an action plan based on the findings.

A **descriptive-evaluative-correlational research design** was employed using researcher-made questionnaires. Data were analyzed using frequency, percentage, weighted mean, rank order, Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W), and Chi-square test, with a 0.05 level of significance.

## Findings

1. **Compliance with MATATAG Curriculum Standards**: All indicators were rated _Much Compliant (MC)_, in descending order:

   - School Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives: 4.45
   - Institutional Planning and Development: 4.41
   - Instructional Leadership: 4.39
   - Curriculum, Assessment, and Instruction: 4.31
   - Academic Support and Student Development Services: 4.30
   - Faculty: 4.10
   - Physical Plant and Instructional Support Facilities: 4.10
   - Administration and Governance: 4.10
   - School Budget and Finances: 4.00

2. **Significance of Agreement in Compliance Rankings**: All W and χ² values were not significant _(p > 0.05)_; thus, the hypothesis was accepted.

3. **Compliance with ESC Certification Assessment Standards**: All indicators were rated _Very Much Compliant (VMC)_:

   - PEAC Team’s School Certification Report: 4.75
   - School Certification Assessment Instrument Report: 4.51
   - MATATAG Curriculum Areas: 4.50

4. **Significance of Agreement in ESC Compliance Rankings**: All indicators had _(p > 0.05)_; the null hypothesis was accepted.

5. **Challenges in Compliance** (descending order):

   - Organizational Support: 4.12 (_Much Challenging_)
   - Operational Support: 3.90 (_Much Challenging_)
   - Instructional Support: 3.30 (_Challenging_)
   - Stakeholder Engagement: 3.25 (_Challenging_)

6. **Solutions Offered** (rated _Much Needed_ with mean 4.41):

   - Faculty and staff training programs: 5.00
   - Strengthened monitoring mechanisms: 5.00
   - Implemented action plans: 4.96

7. **Agreement on Challenges vs. Solutions**:

   - _Challenges_: All _(p > 0.05)_ — no significant agreement
   - _Solutions_: _(W = 0.62, χ² = 43.40, p < 0.001)_ — null hypothesis rejected

8. **Action Plan**: Formulated based on findings.

## Conclusions

1. The compliance level with MATATAG standards is _Much Compliant_.
2. There is **no significant agreement** in the rank orders of compliance with MATATAG standards.
3. The compliance with ESC Certification is _Very Much Compliant_.
4. There is **no significant agreement** in ESC compliance ranking.
5. The challenges are generally _Challenging_ to _Much Challenging_.
6. The proposed solutions are _Much Needed_.
7. There is **no significant agreement** on the ranking of challenges, but there **is significant agreement** on the ranking of solutions.
8. An action plan was developed based on the study findings.

## Recommendations

1. **School administrators** should align school goals with national standards, enhance tech integration, and improve student-centered teaching.
2. **DepEd and private school associations** should develop unified tools for MATATAG standard compliance to ensure consistency.
3. **Schools** must strengthen documentation, improve instructional quality, and provide ongoing ESC-aligned trainings.
4. Use a **standardized reporting and internal evaluation framework** across all schools.
5. **School leaders** should allocate adequate resources, minimize administrative loads, consult regularly with faculty, and form compliance task forces.
6. Conduct **immediate training, establish monitoring systems**, and create data-driven strategic plans.
7. Ensure **context-based implementation** of agreed solutions, guided by school-level diagnostics.
8. **Implement the formulated Action Plan** for continuous improvement.
