## 1. Introduction

Education is the foundation for developing students’ intellectual, social, and emotional skills. However, classrooms today are made up of learners with different abilities, interests, and learning styles. This makes it difficult for teachers to meet everyone’s needs using only traditional teaching methods. To address this, alternative strategies such as Collaborative Learning, Project-Based Learning (PBL), Flipped Classroom, and Technology-Assisted Learning have been introduced. These approaches encourage active participation, critical thinking, and better academic results.

The studies both foreign and local author affirm the effectiveness of these strategies. Johnson et al. (2014) explained that collaborative learning builds teamwork, communication skills, and deeper understanding. Bishop and Verleger (2013) found that the flipped classroom boosts motivation and comprehension by moving direct instruction outside the classroom, giving more time for interactive activities during class. Hung (2015) showed that project-based learning develops problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and long-term knowledge. Chen and Yang (2019) discovered that technology-assisted learning provides flexibility and independence, allowing students to study anytime and anywhere. In the Philippines, Aranda et al. (2016) found that collaborative and project-based activities improved participation in Science Education. Aquino and De Guzman (2021) noted that the flipped classroom increased motivation and understanding among pre-service teachers. Similarly, Insorio (2024) highlighted that technology-integrated activities supported students’ performance and participation in local classrooms. Overall, these studies show that alternative strategies can meet the changing needs of learners in both private and public schools.

Despite these positive findings, there are still gaps, particularly in understanding how these strategies affect Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) students, future educators who require strong comprehension, critical thinking, and engagement skills to succeed in their professional roles. This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of alternative learning strategies on the reading comprehension and academic performance of BEED students at Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. Specifically, it explores how these approaches influence knowledge retention, assessment performance, engagement, motivation, and critical thinking, providing evidence-based insights for curriculum and instructional improvement.

## 2. Methodology

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of alternative learning strategies, Collaborative Learning, Project-Based Learning, Flipped Classroom, and Technology-Assisted Learning, on the reading comprehension and academic performance of Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) students of Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc. Additionally, it assessed the extent of the level of effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing knowledge retention, critical thinking, learning engagement, motivation, and assessment performance. The study also measured the significance in the rank orders of the levels of effectiveness of the four strategies and identified the challenges encountered by students while using them. Finally, policy recommendations were formulated based on the findings to strengthen the integration of these strategies into teacher education programs and to enhance instructional practices.

This study employed the descriptive-quantitative-inferential research method. The descriptive method was used to present the profile of BEED students and to analyze their experiences with the four alternative learning strategies. Various statistical tools, such as frequency count, percentage, weighted mean, and rank, were utilized to analyze the gathered data and determine the level of effectiveness of each strategy. Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance W (Siegel, 1998) was applied to measure the degree of agreement among students regarding the effectiveness and challenges of the strategies, while the Chi-square test was used to examine significant associations between respondents’ profiles and their perceptions.

### The Five-Point Rating Scale Rating Form

A five-point rating scale was used to assess the effectiveness of the alternative learning strategies and the challenges encountered by Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) students in using them. The scale was adapted and modified from validated questionnaires developed by Avila (2016) and Batanes (2012) for evaluating instructional strategies, ensuring that it accurately reflected the objectives of this study.

### Table 10. The Level of Effectiveness of Alternative Learning Strategies on the reading comprehension

Table 10 show the effectiveness of alternative learning strategies on the reading comprehension of Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED). All four strategies show a positive effect on the reading comprehension, as indicated by the overall weighted mean of 4.04, which is interpreted as “Much Effective (ME)”. Technology-Assisted Learning ranked first (4.13, ME), followed by Collaborative Learning (4.10, ME) and Project-Based Learning (4.09, ME). The Flipped Classroom recorded the lowest mean (3.84, ME) but remains effective. The findings revealed that integrating technology, collaboration and project-based approaches greatly supports student comprehension, with fourth-year students showing higher adaptability and engagement than lower year levels.

| Indicators | First Year | Second Year | Third Year | Fourth Year | Average Wx | Int | R |
|------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----|---|
| Collaborative Learning | 3.81 ME 2 | 3.98 ME 1 | 4.16 ME 1 | 4.46 ME 2 | 4.10 ME | | 2 |
| Project-Based Learning | 3.65 ME 3 | 3.93 ME 2 | 4.08 ME 2 | 4.68 VME 1 | 4.09 ME | | 3 |
| Flipped Classroom | 3.38 E 4 | 3.76 ME 3 | 3.75 ME 4 | 4.45 ME 3 | 3.84 ME | | 4 |
| Technology Assisted Learning | 3.86 ME 1 | 4.22 ME 4 | 4.04 ME 3 | 4.41 ME 4 | 4.13 ME | | 1 |
| Average | 3.68 ME | 3.97 ME | 4.01 ME | 4.5 ME | 4.04 ME | | |

### Table 15. Challenges Encountered Using Alternative Learning Strategies

Table 15, presents the different indicators used to evaluate the challenges encountered by BEED students in technology-assisted and blended learning environments. Based on the responses of students from 1st year to 4th year, the results showed varying levels of difficulty, with most indicators rated as Much Challenging or Challenging. In descending order, the most challenging issues were: “I find it challenging to understand lessons without direct interaction with a teacher” (3.77), “I get easily distracted by social media or other apps while using digital learning tools” (3.75), “I find it challenging to evaluate my own learning progress without regular teacher feedback” (3.67), “I find it hard to ask questions or seek clarification during online or modular learning” (3.58), “I find it difficult to adapt to frequent changes in learning platforms or formats” (3.54), and “Using online platforms and tools in blended learning settings is challenging for me” (3.51). Meanwhile, lower-ranked but still notable concerns included internet connectivity issues (3.51), lack of routine or discipline due to flexible schedules (3.48), anxiety during virtual presentations (3.41), and limited technical or digital literacy (3.34). These findings suggest that while alternative learning strategies are effective in enhancing learning outcomes, their implementation requires additional support such as better resource allocation, training, and scheduling adjustments. Addressing these challenges will help students engage more effectively and benefit fully from these innovative teaching approaches.

### Table 9. The test of significant agreement on the rank orders of Level of Effectiveness of Alternative Learning Strategies on the reading comprehension

Table 9, presents the test of significant agreement on the rank orders of the level of effectiveness of the alternative learning strategies on the reading comprehension skills among BEED learners. The agreement was assessed using the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (W) and the Chi-Square Test.

For Collaborative Learning, the computed coefficient of concordance is W = 0.39, with a Chi-square value of 6.24, degrees of freedom (df = 4), and a p-value of 0.1819. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted, indicating no significant agreement among the groups on its effectiveness. For Project-Based Learning, a high concordance value was observed (W = 0.89), with a computed Chi-square of 14.24 and a p-value of 0.0066. This value is below 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a statistically significant agreement among the groups in ranking this strategy as effective. Similarly, Flipped Classroom yielded a W of 0.75, a Chi-square value of 12, and a p-value of 0.0174. Since the p-value is also below 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating significant agreement among the groups on the effectiveness of this strategy. This suggests that students across different year levels share similar positive perceptions of its ability to promote active learning and improve comprehension. Its consistent acceptance highlights its potential as a reliable method for fostering deeper understanding of reading materials. On the other hand, Technology-Assisted Learning showed very low agreement (W = 0.05), with a Chi-square value of 0.8 and a p-value of 0.9384. As the p-value is far above 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted, and there is no significant agreement among the groups regarding the effectiveness of this strategy. This may be due to differences in students’ access to devices, internet stability, and familiarity with digital tools. Such variation emphasizes the need for equitable access and proper technical support to maximize its benefits.

| Indicator | Collaborative Learning | Project- Based Learning | Flipped Classroom | Technology Assisted Learning |
