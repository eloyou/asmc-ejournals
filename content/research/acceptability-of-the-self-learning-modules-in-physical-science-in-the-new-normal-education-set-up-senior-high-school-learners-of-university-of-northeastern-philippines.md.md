## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a nationwide lockdown in mid-March, suspending classes across Luzon and major cities in the Philippines, leading to a rapid shift to remote or modular distance learning. Amidst concerns about achieving learning outcomes during this global health crisis, the efficacy of online and modular distance learning in Philippine Basic Education schools remains unexplored. The Department of Education (DepEd) Iriga City Division persists in delivering basic education, exploring various learning delivery approaches like Online Learning, Modular Distance Learning, Blended Learning, Radio-Based Instruction, and TV-Based Instruction. However, transitioning to modular distance learning poses challenges for ensuring quality education delivery. DepEd is enhancing teacher capacity and developing self-learning modules tailored to essential competencies. Yet, concerns persist about these modules' adequacy, particularly in fundamental skill development, like reading and writing, especially for lower-grade levels. Parental support is crucial for student motivation and success in this new education landscape. Collaborative efforts are vital among schools, parents, and stakeholders to ensure quality education. Research assessing module acceptability among learners, parents, jurors, and teachers is essential for informed policy and practice amidst the pandemic. Despite challenges, the Philippine government underscores education's paramount importance, emphasizing resilience in providing quality education amid adversity.

The studies conducted by both foreign and local authors have significantly enriched the researcher's understanding and approach to their research. Dr. Jayaram (2020) emphasizes the critical role of study materials in the success of distance education, highlighting the unique challenges of writing for this mode of learning. Dr. Dorababu (2020) underscores the importance of self-learning materials in providing distance learners with comprehensive learning experiences akin to those in a traditional classroom setting. Furthermore, Jean-Marc Sabatier (2015) stresses the need for regular revision of self-learning materials to incorporate advancements in the field and enhance their relevance and effectiveness. Eric (2019) discusses the shift towards distance education facilitated by various communication media, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, offering principles for educators to consider in designing effective distance learning experiences. Finally, according to Gureckis and Markant (2017), self-directed learning offers numerous advantages, including the optimization of educational experiences, active engagement in encoding and retaining information, and exposure to new and useful knowledge not accessible through passive means. These insights collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities and opportunities inherent in distance education and self-directed learning.

## Methodology

This study aimed to determine the acceptability of self-learning modules in Physical Science within the new normal education setup among Senior High School learners at the University of Northeastern Philippines. Additionally, it assessed the acceptability of these modules based on Objectives, Content, Language Level, Assessment, and Time Frame. The significance of agreement on the rank orders of the jurors' perception regarding module acceptability was tested. The study also analysed learners' perceptions of module acceptability across these dimensions and assessed differences between jurors' and learners' perceptions. Difficulties encountered by learners in module utilization were identified, and the significance of agreement on the rank and orders of these difficulties was determined. Finally, policy recommendations were formulated to effectively utilize the Self-Learning Module in Physical Science for Grade 11 Senior High School learners.

This study employed the descriptive-evaluative-inferential-correlational method. The descriptive method described the personal and professional profiles of learners and jurors. Various statistical tools, including frequency count, weighted mean, percentage, and rank, were used to determine respondent profiles. Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance W was employed to determine the significance of agreement on rank orders of acceptability and difficulties (Siegel, 1998). The Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for significant differences between jurors' and learners' perceptions of module acceptability.

### The Five-Point Rating Scale for Jurors’ Rating Form

A five-point rating scale was used to evaluate the acceptability of Self Learning Module in Physical Science for Senior high School. It was adapted from the developed questionnaire on acceptability of instructional materials developed by Avila (2016) and Batanes(2012).

| Numerical | Verbal Interpretation | Description                           |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 5         | Excellent             | Manifestation is very much extensive  |
| 4         | Very Satisfactory     | Manifestation is extensive            |
| 3         | Satisfactory          | Manifestation is extensive            |
| 2         | Fair                  | Manifestation is not at all extensive |
| 1         | Needs Improvement     | Manifestation is not at all extensive |

The computed value of z and probability associated with Z were obtained for each key dimension; objectives-1.70 and 0.9554 (p>0.05); content-0.89; language level-1.93 and 0.9732(p>0.05); assessment-1.25 and time-frame-1.17, these were the objective and content greater than the probability associated with z of 0.9554 and 0.9732 at 0.05 level of significance, hence the null hypothesis was rejected this means that there is significant on the difference between the perceptions of the jurors and that of the learners on the acceptability of the modules along with the Objectives and Language Level while the computed z was less than the probability associated ranges from 0.8133 to 0.8925 of Content, Assessment and time-frame. Therefore, the researcher accepted the Null Hypothesis, this means that there is no significant on the difference between the perceptions of the jurors and that of the learners on the acceptability of the modules in terms of content, assessment and timeframe.

Amidst to CoVid-19 pandemic, the educational system of the Philippines is so much affected, that’s why the government under the Department of Education implemented a flexible learning system like blended learning, Online learning and Modular distant learning. Modular distant learning is one of the modality applicable to all students considering the individual differences and capability of the student towards quality education. Hofstein and Naaman (2007) argued that science cannot be meaningful to students without worthwhile practical experiences in the school laboratory. The K-12 basic education curricula must harness the 21st-century skills of the students. These skills include learning and innovation skills, information, media and technology skills, and life and career skills (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009).

**Overall Average: **2.85** – _Sometimes_**

On table 22 is the difficulties were encountered by the learners on the utilization of the modules, it shows the responses of the learner under different strand such STEM, ABM, HUMSS, GAS and TVL, along with the twenty six (26) difficulties first in rank with weighted mean(4.38) were the respondents says “often” that the teacher in Physical Science is approachable, second in rank was (4.28) “often” that the self-learning modules were implemented limiting the laboratory activities experiences due to the implementing guidelines on health protocol amidst to covid-19 pandemic. The table also shows the least in rank on the difficulties encountered by the respondents were their parents have encountered difficulties on communicating with the teacher with the weighted mean (1.93) wherein they are encountered “seldom”, second on the least responses was if the learners have reliable internet connectivity (2.13) wherein they are encountered “seldom” Lastly, if the students have seen errors in the self-learning modules in physical science per month (2.14) says that they are encountered “seldom”. All over the 26 indicators on the difficulties encounter, the researchers gained the average weighted mean (2.85)were rated as “sometimes” The data evidently implies that the learners as well as the jurors were majority says that they encountered the aforementioned difficulties “sometimes” on the utilization of modules amidst to covid-19 pandemic but the researchers found out there are some difficulties wants to emphasize such the following; residing on the city and/or nearby city with good standing of living, encountering poor internet connectivity, lack of gadgets, lack financial needs, un-educated parents to support the learners and lastly residing across the river/risky areas that cause difficulties receiving modules.

To determine whether there is a significant agreement on the rank orders of the difficulties encountered in the utilization of Self-learning modules, the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance W was availed of It could be noted Table 23 that the computed SD was 21,176.5. However, when the coefficient of concordance W was computed the results were this 0.579. The significant of agreement was tested with the use of the Chi-Square test, and results yielded to 72.37. When compared to the X2 tabular values at 0.05 level of significant, the computed X2 failed to reach the tabular criterion level on the respective degrees of freedom. So, these data led the researcher to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, there is significant agreement on the rank orders of the jurors’ assessment on the acceptability of Self-Learning Modules.
