## Abstract

With the sudden shift to online learning brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, this study assesses how effective remote education has been for senior high school students in terms of comprehension, motivation, and academic performance.

## Introduction

Online learning became the primary mode of education during the pandemic. Although convenient, it raised concerns about student engagement, internet access, and learning retention. This study investigates both the benefits and challenges of online learning at Alfelor Sr. Memorial College Inc.

## Statement of the Problem

1. What online platforms are most commonly used by students?
2. How do students rate their learning experience online compared to traditional classrooms?
3. What are the primary challenges faced during online learning?

## Methodology

A mixed-method approach was used. 80 students were surveyed, and 5 were interviewed. Google Classroom, Zoom, and Facebook Messenger were the most commonly used platforms.

## Results and Discussion

- 65% of students preferred traditional learning over online classes.
- The most reported challenges were unstable internet connection and lack of motivation.
- Students who followed a fixed schedule performed better than those without structured routines.

## Conclusion

Online learning is a helpful alternative but cannot fully replace face-to-face classes. Structured schedules, teacher training, and accessible technology are key factors for improving effectiveness.

## Recommendations

- Provide internet/data assistance to low-income students.
- Conduct regular teacher-student check-ins.
- Create hybrid models combining the best of online and traditional learning.
